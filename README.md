# AMC_blockchain_v1.0
In this project I will try to implement basic blockchain principles. From basic adding to array to complete blockchain with multiple nodes-servers and client.

In development process.

v1.0 - first attempt of complex blockchain implementation

v2.0 - second attempt and SUCCESSFUL complex blockchain implementation 
(on Typescript, with CryptoJS, Docker backend (Node work), P2P and HTTP server deployment, other external software usage)
  // pushed to GitHub as branch develop_2.0
  // requires web-page info getter development

v3.0 - third and simplest way to create base blockchain 
(web-page inserted data writes into the blockchain)
  // displays blockchain info in charts/tables (online changes)

Other changes are on the way.
This is part one.

Part two - create a coin and some landing web-page.
